# class CardGame:
#  In the first function the first mistake would be the =' is meant to be '==' 
#  The second mistake is the syntax mistake of a missing ':' on the 'else'
  # def check_for_ace(self, card):
  #   if card.value = 1:
  #     return True
  #   else
  #     return False

#  In the second function the first mistake is the spelling mistake 'dif' should be 'def'
#  - without 'def' the function is not defined
#  The second mistake is in the first return its asking to return 'card' but card doesnt exist in this function
#  - the return should be asking for 'card1' otherwise it will not know what to return
#  There is a missing comma in between 'card1 card2' in the parameter for the defined function 'highest_card'
  # dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  # if card1.value > card2.value:
  #   return card
  # else:
  #   return card2
  
#  In the third function, the first mistake is an indentation error. 
#  - def should be indented by one otherwise the function will not be properly defined
#  The next mistake is that total has no given value
#  - it needs to have an '=' with the given value, which will start with 0 in this case
#  The next mistake is that the return needs to be a written like this: 'return "You have a total of " + str(total)
#  If you try to return it in the current way its written it wont know how to return 'total'nits currently an INT
#  It will need to be turned into a str in order for it to be printed properly.
# def cards_total(self, cards):
#   total
#   for card in cards:
#     total += card.value
#     return "You have a total of" + total
